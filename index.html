          Jazakum Allah Kheir to all of you for prioritizing your children’s Islamic education and helping them develop strong identities as Muslims that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. This knowledge goes beyond any contest and is foundational for Muslims of all ages.

          We have attached the following resources that your children will be tested on in the Spring Knowledge Competition. The competition is open for ages <b>5-18.</b> Even if you are unable to participate in the contest, please share these materials with your children as they are of great benefit. You have about 2 months to prepare for the competition, and the exact date will be announced in a later email.

          Allah has instructed believers to enter into Islam with the entirety of their lives. As Muslims, we should place our deen at the center of our lives, and it should be the driving force in everything we do. When we engage with others in school, in business, and personal relationships we do so with the best of character; we are always honest and trustworthy, and we never intentionally seek to harm anyone. As Muslims, we are always diligent about our prayers, our fasting, our zakat, and all other acts of ibadah, and we also realize that our Islam should be reflected in our character and every aspect of our lives. Please help your children understand the following verse of the Quran.

          Love of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ
        </p>
        <p class="concept">
          We can increase our love and appreciation for our beloved Messenger by viewing him through the lens of those who lived with him and understanding the affection they had toward him. Read about some examples of the Sahabah’s love for our beloved Messenger:
        </p>
        <ol class="concept-list">
          <li>
            <p>
              Like the story of Zayd ibn ad-Dathina related by Imam al-Bayhaqi from ‘Urwa (radhi Allahu ‘anh), when the mushrikun wanted to kill Zayd, they asked him if he would like it if Muhammad (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) was in his place right now, and he was free with his family, he replied in the negative, and even said that he would not want even a thorn to prick the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam)! Hearing this, Abu Sufyan, who had not accepted Islam yet said: “I had not seen anyone love someone like the love of the companions of Muhammad for Muhammad!”
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              like the story of Thawban, the freed slave of the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam), who would become very impatient when he would not see the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam), and his complexion would change. In one of the days, he expressed his worthy to the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) that in the Afterlife, he will not see him because the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) would be raised with the prophets, whilst he will be at a lower level of Jannah. Hearing this, the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) got revelation, in which Allah Ta’ala says: {Those who obey Allah and the Messenger are with those whom Allah has blessed, namely, the prophets, the Siddiqīn, the Shuhadā’ and the righteous. And excellent are they as companions.} [an-Nisa 4:69]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              when the Ansar said: “In the hour of distress it is we who are called (for help). but the spoils are given to other people besides us.” This remark reached the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) and he gathered them in a tent and said: “What is this news that has reached me on your behalf?” They kept silence. Upon this he said: “O people of Ansar, do you not like that people should go away with worldly riches, and you go away with Muhammad taking him to your houses?” They said: “Yes, happy we are, Messenger of Allah!” The Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) said: “If the people were to tread a valley, and the Ansar were to tread a narrow path, I would take the narrow path of the Ansar.” [Sahih Muslim 1059]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              when Rabi‘a ibn Ka‘b said: “I was with Allah’s Messenger at night, and when I brought him his water for ablution and what he required, he told me to make a request. I said, “I ask to accompany you in paradise.” He asked if I had any other request to make, and when I replied that that was all, he said, “Then help me to accomplish this for you by devoting yourself often to prostration.” [Sahih Muslim 489]
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It was narrated by Anas bin Malik (radhi Allahu ‘anh): “Abu Bakr and al-‘Abbas passed by one of the gatherings of the Ansar who were weeping then. He asked, “Why are you weeping?” They replied, “We are weeping because we remember the gathering of the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) with us.” So Abu Bakr went to the Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) and told him of that. The Prophet (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) came out, tying his head with a piece of the hem of a sheet. He ascended the pulpit which he never ascended after that day. He glorified and praised Allah and then said, “I request you to take care of the Ansar as they are my near companions to whom I confided my private secrets. They have fulfilled their obligations and rights which were enjoined on them but there remains what is for them. So, accept the good of the good-doers amongst them and excuse the wrongdoers amongst them.” [Sahih al-Bukhari 3799]
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p class="concepts">
          In another hadith, Anas (radhi Allahu ‘anh) reported that after the death of the Messenger of Allah (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam), Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar: “Let us visit Umm Ayman as the Messenger of Allah (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) used to visit her. As we came to her, she wept. They (Abu Bakr and Umar) said to her: What makes you weep? What is in store (in the next world) for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is better than (this worldly life). She said: I weep not because I am ignorant of the fact that what is in store for the Messenger of Allah (sal Allahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) is better, but I weep because the revelation which came from the Heaven has ceased to come.” This moved both of them to tears and they began to weep along with her.

          What it means to enjoin good and forbid evil:
        </p>
        <p class="concepts">
          One of our most important tasks as believers is to enjoin that which is good and forbid the evil; in other words, we guide others to the truth of the deen and what Allah has commanded and guide people away from the haram and that which Allah has forbidden. The following Hadith is not for memorization, but it is to help you understand the danger of seeing something wrong in a society and not trying to do something about it through a beautiful analogy given to us by our Prophet ﷺ:
          <br/>
          <p class="arabic">
          مَثَلُ الْقَائِمِ عَلَى حُدُودِ اللَّهِ وَالْوَاقِعِ فِيهَا كَمَثَلِ قَوْمٍ اسْتَهَمُوا عَلَى سَفِينَةٍ فَأَصَابَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَعْلَاهَا وَبَعْضُهُمْ أَسْفَلَهَا فَكَانَ الَّذِينَ فِي أَسْفَلِهَا إِذَا اسْتَقَوْا مِنْ الْمَاءِ مَرُّوا عَلَى مَنْ فَوْقَهُمْ فَقَالُوا لَوْ أَنَّا خَرَقْنَا فِي نَصِيبِنَا خَرْقًا وَلَمْ نُؤْذِ مَنْ فَوْقَنَا فَإِنْ يَتْرُكُوهُمْ وَمَا أَرَادُوا هَلَكُوا جَمِيعًا وَإِنْ أَخَذُوا عَلَى أَيْدِيهِمْ نَجَوْا وَنَجَوْا جَمِيعًا
          </p>
          <p>
            “The parable of those who respect the limits of Allah and those who violate them is that of people who board a ship after casting lots, some of them residing in its upper deck and others in its lower deck. When those in the lower deck want water, they pass by the upper deck and say: If we tear a hole in the bottom of the ship, we will not bother those above us. If those in the upper deck let them do what they want, they will all be destroyed together. If they restrain them, they will all be saved together.”
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            It is also important to remember that although we are not in control of results, Allah expects righteous actions and efforts on our part; we should never think that our good deeds are meaningless no matter how small they are, because Allah will reward all the good that is done sincerely for His sake. <br>Allah tells us in Surat At-Tawba:
          </p>
          <p class="arabic">
          وَقُلِ ٱعْمَلُوا۟ فَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۖ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَـٰلِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَـٰدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ ١٠٥
          </p>
          <p>
            Tell ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Do as you will. Your deeds will be observed by Allah, His Messenger, and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.” (105)

          The Importance of Da’wah in Islam
        </p>
        <p class="concepts">
          As Muslims, we believe that we must not keep our religion to ourselves. Allah expects us to share the light of our deen with all of humanity and invite people to Islam. The Muslim must not be selfish and should be someone who genuinely cares about the well-being of those around him.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Allah says in Surat Aal-Imraan:
          <p class="arabic">
          ولتكن منكم أمة يدعون إلى الخير
          </p>
          <p>
            AND LET THERE ARISE FROM AMONGST YOU, A NATION THAT CALLS UPON PEOPLE TO DO WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>

            Therefore, calling people to the truth of Islam and guiding them away from evil is an essential part of our religion. When we present Islam to people, we must remind them that Allah has only ever sent down one religion to humankind; people may have developed different beliefs about God throughout history but the message of Tawheed has always remained constant. Therefore, especially when we are in dialogue with Christians and Jews, we should never present Islam as a third religion sent to humanity; instead, we should make clear that Islam is the religion of Ibraheem, Musa, Isa, and all the prophets. They all had the same message of worshiping Allah alone; the Christians may think that we are rejecting Jesus, but our message to them is that we embrace the true message of ‘Isa: that he was a prophet who called to worship Allah alone, and not a son of God who asked people to worship him. We do not reject anything that ‘Isa Alayhi As-Salam said about himself; we only reject the lies that have been said about him.

          Understanding Zakat
        </p>
        <p class="concepts">
          Zakat Ul-Maal:
          <br/>
          Muslims pay 2.5% of the money that they had saved for an entire year. In order for Zakat to become obligatory upon a Muslim, he/she must have had the minimum amount required (known as the nisaab in Arabic) for an entire year (twelve lunar months), what we call the hawl in Arabic.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          So, how much is the nisaab?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The amount of wealth that you have had for an entire year needs to reach the equivalent of at least 85 grams of gold or 595 grams of silver for Zakat to become obligatory. From this overall saved wealth that you have had for an entire year, you pay 2.5% in Zakat.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          And, who can Zakat be paid to?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In the Quran, Allah gives us eight categories of people to whom zakat can be paid. For participants in the 14-18 age group, please memorize the following verse; participants in the 9-13 age group must simply understand it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <p class="arabic">
          ۞ إِنَّمَا ٱلصَّدَقَـٰتُ لِلْفُقَرَآءِ وَٱلْمَسَـٰكِينِ وَٱلْعَـٰمِلِينَ عَلَيْهَا وَٱلْمُؤَلَّفَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَفِى ٱلرِّقَابِ وَٱلْغَـٰرِمِينَ وَفِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ ۖ فَرِيضَةًۭ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌۭ
          </p>
          <p>
            Zakāh expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed for it1 and for bringing hearts together [for Islām] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allāh and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allāh. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="title">
            Here are the eight categories summarized and described:
          </p>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Fuqaraa’: these are the people who are completely poor and are unable to meet any of their basic needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Masakeen: these are people who are still needy but are not as poor as the fuqaraa’; they are able to meet about half of their needs for the entire year.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Those employed for it”: these are the people who collect the Zakat and are responsible for its distribution. Allah has made them eligible to receive zakat payments themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              “And for bringing hearts together”: this refers to paying zakat to people (generally those in power) in order to soften their hearts toward Islam and prevent harm from befalling the Muslims
            </li>
            <li>
              “Freeing captives or slaves”: you can pay zakat to free someone from being enslaved or held captive
            </li>
            <li>
              “Those in debt”: you can pay zakat to help your brother or your sister get out of serious financial distress that could really cause them harm if not alleviated.
            </li>
            <li>
              “For the cause of Allah”: you can pay zakat to support those who are defending Islam and Muslims. Many modern scholars now say that this category of zakat can be used to build masajid and provide Islamic knowledge in non-Muslim countries if there is no entity responsible for providing these services.
            </li>
            <li>
              “For the stranded traveler”: you can pay zakat to help the person who was traveling and became stuck and needs money to be able to continue
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
          <p>
            Unlike sadaqah, Zakat must be paid to Muslims only, except for the category of softening people’s hearts toward Islam; that is the only category of people in which the recipients could potentially be non-Muslim. You also do not have to pay zakat within every category; you simply must choose from among these eight categories, but some scholars say it is better to pay within as many of these categories as you can.
          </p>
          <p>


            <span class="question">
              When do I pay zakat on the things that I own?
            </span>
            <span class="answer">
              In general, things that you own just for your personal use (like the car that you drive or the house you live in), you do not have to pay zakat on. You must pay zakat on money, gold, silver, and things that you bought with the intention to resell.
              <br>
              <br>
              Some scholars believe that you do not have to pay zakat on jewelry, even if it’s made of gold and silver, if the jewelry is solely for personal use and the owner has no intention whatsoever to sell them. These scholars say if you have the intention to eventually resell it then you pay zakat on its value.
              <br>
              <br>
              However, other scholars believe that although jewelry for personal use that is not made of gold and silver doesn’t have Zakat paid on it, jewelry that is made of gold and silver, even if it is for personal use, must be included in one’s Zakat.
              <br>
              <br>
              In general, for anything that you buy with the intention to resell, such as real estate and stocks, you pay Zakat off of the value of the product; anything you buy in order to generate income off of, you would pay Zakat from the income generated and not the value of the product.

            The original opinion of the majority of scholars was that Zakat Ul-Fitr should be paid in food, because that was the original command of the Prophet ﷺ; however, even some early scholars, such as Imam Abu Hanifa and Hasan Al-Basri, believed that Zakat Ul-Fitr could be paid in money. This system of monetary payments for Zakat Ul-Fitr was embraced by the khalifah Omar ibn Abd Al-Aziz. Many modern scholars believe that Zakat Ul-Fitr could be paid in money because food is no longer widely used as a means of currency in most parts of the world and in many parts of the world people are not in desperate need of basic food products. In such cases, money would be more useful for poor individuals. Both opinions, the one that states Zakat Ul-Fitr must be paid in food and the one that states it could also be paid in money, must be respected.
